# Hi, I'm Binayak Lamsal👋

I am a research-driven Chemical Engineer with interdisciplinary experience spanning process engineering, nanotechnology, quantum chemistry fundamentals, and environmental systems design. My work bridges experimental methods and computational tools—ranging from nanofiber fabrication and electrospinning to process simulations, adsorption studies, and scrubber system optimization. I am particularly interested in developing efficient, sustainable, and scalable chemical processes through rigorous analysis, simulation, and data-driven evaluation.
